## Wine Not? Classifying wine samples based on physicochemical properties

The goal of this project was to use supervised learning classfication techniques to classify wine samples into red or white dependent on their physicochemical properties. The dataset came from Kaggle and I used a multitude of classification techniques, voting classifiers and feature engineering to build a model with 99% accuracy. I then built a dashboard using Tableau to analyze the results of my model and understand why some samples may have been missclassified.  

**Tools:**
- PostgreSQL, AWS and SQLAlchemy (To store and retrieve data) 
- Python (Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) 
- Supervised Learning Techniques (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, VotingClassifier) 
- Visualization (Tableau) 

**Repository Includes:** 
- Jupyter Notebook of full project process
- Modules including built functions for the process
